        <h3>About Brandon</h3>
        <p>I've worked the past few years as a CNC laser operator, learning G&M code and many lessions about the industry and what it means to develop and lead a team. Wanting to change careers I took the leap to start my path down software development with Thinkful.</p>
        <p>I'm a creative mind that likes creating through hobbies such as leathworking, foamsmithing, or carpentry and want to put that mind to use designing websites and programs.</p>
        <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer or need ideas feel free to contact me</p>
